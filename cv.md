My academic research has been cited over 500 times. My non-academic publications have been used as the basis of educational modules, internal project development, and have helped spur engagement of individuals from under-represented STEM backgrounds.

My work is strongly interdisciplinary, focusing on geoinformatics, paleoecology, basic plant biology, quantitative analysis and social systems within academia.  I am a project leader within the [Neotoma Paleoecological Database](http://neotomadb.org/), am a member of the [EarthCube](http://earthcube.org/) Leadership Committee and chair of the EarthCube Engagement Committee. 

My commitment to community extends beyond my academic roles.  I am on the Board of Directors of the [Kids Sing Chorus](http://www.kidssingchorus.ca/), a non-profit organization that makes a choral experience available free of charge to children in East Vancouver communities who may not otherwise have access to music education (feel free to [donate](http://www.kidssingchorus.ca/#!donate-)!)
