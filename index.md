We are faced with "wicked"<sup><small>1</small></sup> problems that increasingly require us to leverage multiple datasets, analytic approaches, and research philosophies in an effort to solve some of the most pressing issues facing society today.  

My research focuses on relationships between biotic systems and large scale climatic change at time-scales of centuries to millenia, but my research efforts focus on facilitating broader engagement with the tools and methods neccessary to build the technical toolkits we require to move forward as a society.

While domain specific knowledge is important in managing research questions or looking for solutions, experience in building infrastructure, teaching and learning with partners, handling data through complex workflows, and managing projects with multiple interconnected components.

<small>1: Rittel & Webber [1973](http://www.uctc.net/mwebber/Rittel+Webber+Dilemmas+General_Theory_of_Planning.pdf): *"We use the term “wicked” in a meaning akin to that of “malignant” (in contrast to “benign”) or “vicious” (like a circle) or “tricky” (like a leprechaun) or “aggressive” (like a lion, in contrast to the docility of a lamb)."*</small>
