# Advanced Neotoma for Fun and Profit

# What we'll learn

This document is intended to act as a more complete vignette of the `neotoma` package's functionality.  I'll show some functions & behaviour that's not neccessarily shown in the examples or the [*Open Quaternary* paper](http://www.openquaternary.com/articles/10.5334/oq.ab/).  Some of these examples are pretty straightforward, some are a bit more complicated.  I've made an effort to clearly comment code, but welcome any suggestions.  If you do have bug fixes, comments, or requests for additional examples, please let me know at [goring@wisc.edu]() or through the issues for [my website's GitHub repository](http://github.com/SimonGoring/simongoring.github.io/issues).

# Data Exploration Made Easy

It's a bit of a pain to download lots of records and then visualize them in R, or at least, it had been.  In building the package I wanted to try to limit the need to install lots of other packages, so the basic `plot()` method isn't all that helpful:


```r
library(neotoma)

# I'll try as much as I can to use the PACKAGE::FUNCTION() convention, although
# you don't need to use it.  Since this is a learning document I think it help
# make it a bit more explicit where these calls are coming from.

all_wi <- neotoma::get_dataset(gpid = "Wisconsin")
```

```
## The API call was successful, you have returned 501 records.
```

```r
plot(all_wi)
```

![*All Neotoma data points in Wisconsin, with symbols identifying dataset type.*](neotoma_lab_meeting_files/figure-html/plot_sites-1.png)

So, we can see the different dataset types. You can pretty much make out Wisconsin, but it doesn't look that great, and it's certainly not publication quality.  We can make a better map, an interactive map, using leaflet.  That's pretty fun, and the [RStudio help page for `leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) is really great to get you started.  Make sure the `leaflet` package is installed using `install.packages('leaflet')`, and then let's check out what we get:


```r
library(leaflet)

# We're going to use this multiple times I think, so let's make it a function:

leaflet_map <- function(dataset_in) {
  dataset_summary <- do.call(rbind, lapply(dataset_in, 
                        function(x){
                          # here we pull out the site information from the `dataset` objects:
                          data.frame(name = x$site.data$site.name,
                                     lat  = x$site.data$lat + runif(1, -0.005, 0.005),
                                     long = x$site.data$long + runif(1, -0.005, 0.005),
                                     type = x$dataset.meta$dataset.type)
                        }))
  
  # The leaflet package documentation uses piping.  For the sake of this tutorial, I won't.
  # First, define a color palette for the dataset type symbol plotting.
  pal <- colorFactor("Dark2", domain = levels(dataset_summary$type))
  
  # Now make the leaflet map, add base raster tiles and then add the markers for the records:
  map <- leaflet(data = dataset_summary)
  map <- leaflet::addTiles(map)
  map <- leaflet::addCircleMarkers(map, ~long, ~lat, 
                                   popup = ~paste0("Site: ", as.character(name), "<br>",
                                                   "Type: ", 
                                                   as.character(dataset_summary$type)),
                                   color = ~pal(type),
                                   stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.5)
  # You need to explicitly call the `map` object to make it appear!
  map
}

# Since that's all wrapped in a function, we can all it with any `dataset_list`:
leaflet_map(all_wi)
```

This is much nicer (I think), but it is still missing all the additional information that goes along with a Neotoma record.  We can go directly to the Neotoma Explorer using the `browse` function.  Unfortunately, because of the limitations of URL string length, this doesn't always work:

```r
# Does not work:
neotoma::browse(all_wi)

# Does work:
some_wi <- neotoma::get_dataset(gpid = "Wisconsin", datasettype = "pollen")
neotoma::browse(some_wi)

```

Yay! (A browser window should have opened with your datasets in it).

## Plotting stratigraphic diagrams

Let's say we're looking for all records from Wisconsin with *Larix* pollen, that must have some samples within the middle Holocene:


```r
some_wi <- neotoma::get_dataset(gpid = "Wisconsin", datasettype = "pollen", taxonname = "Larix%", ageyoung = 4000, ageold = 6000)
```

```
## The API call was successful, you have returned 18 records.
```

```r
wi_pollen <- neotoma::get_download(some_wi, verbose = FALSE)
```

```
## Warning: 
## There were multiple entries for Eucalyptus tablets 
## get_download has mapped aliases for the taxa in the taxon.list.

## Warning: 
## There were multiple entries for Eucalyptus tablets 
## get_download has mapped aliases for the taxa in the taxon.list.

```r
leaflet_map(some_wi) # This is the function we made above.
```

I like Devil's Lake, so let's take a look at the pollen.  To get this to work you need the `analogue` package:


```r
library(analogue, quietly = TRUE)

Stratiplot(wi_pollen[[2]])
```

![](neotoma_lab_meeting_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

You have all the advantages of the `Stratiplot()` function now, and the wrapper for the `neotoma` package makes it more useful directly with `download` objects.

## Re-building Age-Models

So, I'm interested in the smoothed surface of *Larix* pollen at 4kyr in the region.  I'm going to do a lazy job of it, but that's my perogative.  I just want you to see what we might do.

First, we know there are different age types in the records.  Let's see what we've got here:


```r
table(sapply(wi_pollen, function(x)x$sample.meta$age.type[1]))
```

```
## 
## Calibrated radiocarbon years BP            Radiocarbon years BP 
##                               5                              13
```

So, that's a lot of records to re-do.  To do it properly, we need all the chron-controls.  When you run this you will get messages letting you know the record has downloaded successfully.  I'm suppressing that message here:


```r
wi_chrons <- neotoma::get_chroncontrol(wi_pollen)
```

Now, lets rebuild the model using `Bchrononlogy()` from the `Bchron` package.  It helps to know the structure of some of these data objects, so take a bit of time to look at them using the `str()` funciton (for "structure").  Can you understand what I'm passing into the `Bchronology()` function?


```r
focal <- wi_chrons[[1]]

new_chron <- Bchron::Bchronology(ages   = focal$chron.control$age,
                    ageSds = focal$chron.control$age - focal$chron.control$age.young,
                    positions = focal$chron.control$depth,
                    calCurves = ifelse(focal$chron.control$control.type %in% 'Radiocarbon', 
                                       'intcal13', 'normal'), 
                    predictPositions = wi_pollen[[1]]$sample.meta$depth)

plot(new_chron)
```

![](neotoma_lab_meeting_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

So, you can see that modelling can take a long time, but, we can basically wrap all that logic into a swell little function & run all the models overnight.  That was part of my motivation for using the variable `focal` in this code example.  Try turning this into a funciton that can work on all of the `download` objects in `wi_pollen`.  Does it work?

Wrapping `Bchronology()` around `neotoma`'s `download` objects is something that's on the TODO list, but there's a lot of art required to build age models & I'm not sure I want to do that quite yet.

But, let's just pretend that we've done a good job and added all these date into the models.  Let's make a model of the records.  I'm using a `gam()` function from the `mgcv` package.


```r
# Running these in sequence gives us a nice narrow dataset, but you should always be aware what 
# taxa have been pushed into the Other class for the taxonomies.  The taxonomies in Neotoma itself
# are expanding as datasets get uploaded, but the translation table in this package is only updated
# occasionally.

wi_p25 <- neotoma::compile_taxa(wi_pollen, "P25")
```

### Finding records by Handle

Someties people only publish their records using handles:


```r
data_ca <- get_dataset(datasettype = "pollen", gpid = "Canada")
```

```
## The API call was successful, you have returned 453 records.
```

```r
data_us <- get_dataset(datasettype = "pollen", gpid = "United States")
```

```
## The API call was successful, you have returned 1014 records.
```

```r
datasets <- neotoma::bind(data_ca, data_us)

handles <- sapply(datasets, function(x)x$dataset.meta$collection.handle)

codes <- c("JACKSON","ARRINGTO","BINNEWTR","WOLFCRK","CAMEL","ROCKYHOC","TULANEG","ANDERSON","CLEARPND","QUICKSND","SANDYRUN","WHITEPND","ALEXISLK")

test_datasets <- sapply(codes, function(x)grep(paste0("^", x, "$"), handles))
output <- datasets[test_datasets]
class(output) <- c("dataset_list", "list")

leaflet_map(output)
```
